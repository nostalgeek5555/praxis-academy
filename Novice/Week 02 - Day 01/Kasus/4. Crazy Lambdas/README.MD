Improve your lambda and method reference skills
### Task
**FunctionMap** is an API that allows you to store and retrieve math functions by string name. Your job is to implement the *todo* section of `Functions.java` class using **Lambda expressions and method reference**, so all tests in `FunctionsTest.java` should pass
 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to be familiar with Java 8

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start implementing the **todo** section, verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the [exercise/completed](https://github.com/bobocode-projects/tdd-exercises/tree/exercise/completed/binary-search-tree) branch and see the final implementation
